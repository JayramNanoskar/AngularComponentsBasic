*****Smart component/ Controller component*****
*It doesn't need to fed all the info(to call it, just need tag/selector only)
*It gets all the data it needs(using service calls and all) and passes required data to the child
*Default App Component is smart component

*****Dumb component/ Presentational component*****
*It has to fed all the info, it doesn't know much(to call it, needs to pass data along with tag/selector)
*It take in everything needs and renders the view. So can work in any application with providing required data
*It's handed all data it needs. It doesn't have much logic
